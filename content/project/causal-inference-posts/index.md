A series of blog posts explaining key causal inference concepts and methodologies in my own words, with lots of R code examples, visualisations and memes. Low-key aimed towards people like me, who find these ideas easier to grasp with code/algorithms and simulations rather than with math notation.

1.  [Introduction to causal diagrams (DAGs)](https://franciscoyira.com/post/2021-07-11-diagramas-causalidad-cap-3-causal-inference-mixtape/) *(available [in Spanish](https://franciscoyira.com/es/post/2021-07-11-diagramas-causalidad-cap-3-causal-inference-mixtape/))*

2.  [Potential Outcomes Model (or why correlation is not causality)](https://franciscoyira.com/post/potential-outcomes-causal-inference-mixtape/) *(available [in Spanish](https://franciscoyira.com/es/post/potential-outcomes-causal-inference-mixtape/))*

3.  [Randomization Inference in R: a better way to compute p-values in randomized experiments](https://franciscoyira.com/post/randomization-inference-causal-mixtape/) *(available [in Spanish](https://franciscoyira.com/es/post/randomization-inference-causal-mixtape/))*

4.  [Matching in R (I): Subclassification, Common Support and the Curse of Dimensionality](https://franciscoyira.com/post/matching-in-r-part-1/)

5.  [Matching in R (II): Differences between Matching and Regression](https://franciscoyira.com/post/matching-in-r-2-differences-regression/)

6.  [Matching in R (III): Propensity score, Weighting and the Double Robust Estimator](https://franciscoyira.com/post/matching-in-r-3-propensity-score-iptw/)

*Work in progress, more posts to come...*

Largely based on these excellent books:

-   [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/), by Scott Cunningham

-   [Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html), by Matheus Facure
