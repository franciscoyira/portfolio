Data scientist, economist, and skilled R programmer. I have experience using machine learning to solve business problems in retail and marketing/CRM, answering business questions through statistical modelling and causal inference, and automating processes and reports.

I am passionate about enabling data-driven decision making and use data to solve problems and generate social impact. I like challenges and I am eager to learn more and share knowledge with others
